This case study explores user behavior and asset performance using a simulated dataset from a healthcare company. The goal was to analyze a dataset of 200K+ entries related to web user behavior and asset performance to identify opportunities to optimize content strategies and improve overall conversion rates. My analysis was conducted in **Jupyter Notebook**, with visualizations built in **Tableau** and **Excel**.
